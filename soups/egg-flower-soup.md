# Egg Flower Soup

## Ingredients

+ 720g white vegetable stock (3 cups)
+ 3 eggs
+ 1/2 tsp msg
+ 20g potato starch
+ white pepper.
+ sesame oil
+ scallions

## Instructions
1. Heat broth in a pot to a boil, add in the 1/2 tsp of msg.
2. Prep eggs by beating together with a few tablespoons of cold broth or water to make the eggs easier to pour. Place in a measuring cup with a spout for easiness.
3. Prep potato starch by making a slurry with water or broth.
4. Once the broth is boiling, bring it down to a simmer. Using a fork make a circular motion in the pot creating a whirlpool. With the other hand slowly drizzle in the eggs in a slow stream. It should take 30seconds - 1 minute to do.
5. Do the same thing with the potato starch slurry and turn off the heat.
6. Add in thinly sliced scallions, 1/4 tsp of white pepper and 1/4 tsp of seasame oil to taste.
