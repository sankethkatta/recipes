## Ingredients

+ 1 head of garlic
+ extra virgin olive oil
+ salt
+ 1 bunch cilantro
+ eggs (optional)
+ white vegetable broth
+ stale sourdough bread

## Instructions

### Cilantro Garlic Paste
1. NOTE: the quality of the vegetable broth will make a big impact on the soup. Make fresh broth with a healthy amount of fennel and leek for the best outcome!
2. Reserve 1 clove of garlic to use raw. Chop the top of the remaining garlic and cover with olive oil and salt, wrap into foil and roast in 400 deg F until soft. You can also confit the garlic directly in a pot of olive oil.
3. Mash the confit garlic and raw in a mortar and pestle with some kosher salt. The raw garlic will add a stronger kick. Be careful with the amount raw garlic.
4. Clear the garlic out of the mortar.
5. Roughly chop the cilantro and use the mortar to mash the cilantro into a paste. Do this in parts if needed and add salt/oil if needed.
6. Return garlic together with cilantro and mash together with a bit of olive oil until the flavor is strong and a bit sharp.

### Croutons
1. Cut bread into cubes (roughly macedoine).
2. Toss with extra virgin olive oil and toast in oven until golden brown.
3. Sprinkle with salt and set aside.

### Putting It Together
1. Warm the broth in a pot.
2. Spoon a few dollops (~2 tbsp) of the paste into the bottom of a bowl.
3. Add in a handful of croutons around the paste.
4. (Optional) place a poached egg over the center of the paste.
5. Ladle roughly 0.5-1 cup of broth over the paste.
6. Serve and let the eater stir and eat.
