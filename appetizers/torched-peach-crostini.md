# Torched Peach Crostini

## Ingredients
+ burratta cheese
+ sourdough bread 
+ 1 bunch basil
+ 4oz/113g/0.5cup extra virgin olive oil
+ yellow peaches
+ dark brown sugar
+ flaky salt (i.e. fleur de sel)

## Instructions

### Basil Oil
1. Prepare an ice bath & set a pot of water to boil.
2. Wash basil and drop in boiling water for 30 seconds. The basil should turn a vivid green.
3. Transfer the basil using a slotted spoon to the ice bath.
4. Once cooled, place the basil on paper towels and let drain completely.
5. Put basil into a blender or food processor, stream in 4-6 oz of olive oil until fully blended.
6. Strain the oil out using a chinois into another bowl to get a finished infused oil.

### Whipped Burrata
1. Drop the whole ball of burrata into a food processor.
2. Give it a couple pulses until slightly chunky, but not fully smooth. It should look a bit like cottage cheese, but slightly smoother.

### Peaches
1. Slice the peach to get 2 half sections (minus the center core). There will be some wastage around the core that can be trimmed and saved for later.
2. Mandolin each peach half into thin 1-2mm slices.
3. Cut the slices in half to create half moons.
4. Arrange each set of three half moons on top of eachother fanning out slightly so the flat edge of each slice is exposed.

### Putting It Together
1. Toast sourdough bread. Use a cutter if you would like it crustless and even in shape.
2. Spoon on the whipped burrata cheese.
3. Drizzle the basil oil using a squeeze bottle.
4. Top with 3 slices of fanned out peaches.
5. Sprinkle an even layer of brown sugar on top of the peaches.
6. Torch the sugar just until it starts to gets blackened/crusted (~3 seconds).
7. Sprinle on top flaky salt to finish.
