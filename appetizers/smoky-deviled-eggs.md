Adapted from [Melissa Clark's Smoky Red Devil Eggs](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012607-smoky-red-devil-eggs).

## Ingredients
+ 12 large eggs
+ 1 fat clove garlic
+ 0.25tsp kosher salt
+ 0.5cup/104g mayo
+ 2tbsp/32g tomato paste
+ 2-4tsp red wine vinegar
+ 0.25tsp black pepper
+ 0.25tsp smoked paprika

## Instructions

### Boiled Eggs
1. Prick the ends of each egg with a sharp needle to break into the shell. This prevents it from exploding while pressure cooking.
2. Place eggs on top of included rack in the Instant Pot. It is okay to stack eggs on top of eachother to get them all in.
3. Pour in 1 cup of water.
4. Set on Pressure Cook for 5 minutes.
5. While it is cooking, prepare an ice bath.
6. Wait for the cooker to come to pressure, run through the 5 minutes, then natural release for another 5 minutes. At this point, manually release any remaining pressure and open the lid.
7. Transfer the eggs to the ice bath and wait another 5 minutes for the eggs to cool.
8. Peel and set aside the eggs.

### Filling
1. Crush garlic into a paste using a knife or mortar and pestle. 
2. Mix in all other ingredients into a bowl and wisk together until smooth.
3. Chop each egg in half and spoon yolks into a food processor.
4. Pulse food processor until yolks look like wet sand and are fluffy/consistent.
5. Slowly add in the wished sauce in parts, blending along the way, until a consistent paste is formed.
6. Taste and adjust ingredients as desired.

### Piping
1. Fit a piping bag with a medium sized star tip.
2. NOTE: The smoother the paste, the easier this step will be. Continue blending the paste if it is not yet smooth.
3. Fill bag with paste and fill in a round motion into each egg cavity. Stop piping and pull away from the center to create a peak.

### Serving
1. Sprinkle with a light dusting of smoked paprika over the eggs to finish.
