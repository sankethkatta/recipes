# Impossible Burger Puffs

## Ingredients

+ 1 pack Impossible burger ground meat
+ 0.5 white onion
+ 0.25 cup dry white wine
+ 1 tbsp unsalted butter
+ 1 package Dufour puff pastry
+ seasame seeds
+ cheddar cheese
+ dijon mustard
+ 1 large egg

## Instructions

### Prep
1. Ensure that the puff pastry has been defrosted in the fridge for at least 4 hours and ready for when you are stuffing cheeseburger filling.

### Impossible Filling
1. Ciseler the onion.
2. Heat some oil (~1 tbsp) on a pan and drop in the onions. Stir until translucent and starting to slightly brown.
3. Drop in the block on impossible burger and break into small pieces using a spatula.
4. Season with salt and some pepper as you go. Continue to stir to ensure even cooking and browning.
5. Once the impossible has cooked and has some crusted bits throughout, spoon out of the pan.
6. While the pan is still on, pour in the white wine to deglaze the pan and scrape fond off the pan.
7. Once the wine has slightly reduced drop in the butter and stir to immulsify into a pan sauce.
8. Mix sauce into the meat.
9. Cover and set into the fridge to cool completely. We want this to be at the same temperature as the puff when we stuff them.

### Stuffing the Puffs
1. Ensure your kitchen is cool (~65F) a warm kitchen will make the puffs melt too quickly.
2. Shred cheddar cheese into small strands. Have dijon mustard ready with a spoon.
3. Cut the Dufour pastry into it's 4 folded parts. Work with 1 part at a time and leave the remaining in the fridge to keep it's cool temperature.
4. Roll out the fourth piece of pastry on a lightly floured surface until it has roughly doubled in size.
5. Using a pastry cutter split the pastry into 12 even pieces.
6. Dollop roughly 0.25tsp of dijon mustard into each puff.
7. Layer that with 1tsp of cheddar cheese.
8. Finally add 1-2 tsps of the impossible filling.
9. With clean hands, place each puff in the palm of your hand and pull/pinch the 4 corners together to create a ball. Place the ball seam-side down into a baking tray.
10. Repeat this for all the remaining dough in the oven to yield a total of 48 balls.

### Cooking
1. Preheat oven to 400deg F.
2. Beat 1 egg in a bowl and brush each puff with the egg wash.
3. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top of each puff.
4. Cook in oven for 20-30 minutes until golden brown.
